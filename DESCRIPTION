Description: 
    Provides tools to visualize time-dependent effect size surfaces 
    (e.g., log-hazard ratio, hazard ratio, average derivative effect), 
    model performance metrics (e.g., C-index, AUC), and decision curve analysis 
    across follow-up time for survival models. 
    Supports Cox proportional hazards models, Random Survival Forests, 
    and XGBoost-based survival models, with utilities for IPCW estimation, 
    stratified modeling, and contour-based visualization. 
    Designed as an extension of the original 'survivalContour' package 
    for more flexible and machine-learning–oriented survival analysis.
